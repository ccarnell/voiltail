## Technical Complexity Concerns

Regarding your technical questions about bias amplification, cascading hallucinations, circuit breakers, etc. - these are excellent enterprise-grade concerns that we should address. Here's how I'd approach them:

__Immediate Priority (Phase 1-2):__

- Circuit breakers and exponential backoff (reliability)
- Basic error propagation (debugging)
- Simple caching (performance)

__Medium Priority (Phase 3-4):__

- Comprehensive audit logging (compliance)
- API key rotation (security)
- Advanced caching strategies

__Long-term (Post-MVP):__

- Bias amplification detection
- Cascading hallucination prevention
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive queries

__My Recommendation:__

1. __Restructure documentation now__ - this will save time and money immediately
2. __Continue this conversation__ for strategic planning and architecture
3. __Start a new conversation__ when you're ready to implement Phase 1
4. __Create a separate technical complexity document__ to address your advanced concerns
